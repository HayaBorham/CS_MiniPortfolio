# CS_MiniPortfolio
A couple of Computer Science projects that I've worked on implementing (code excerpts) via Eclipse IDE.

I) The first project, PK (short for PARKEI) is an amusement park system designed using object-oriented programming principles. This was an individual project in my Computer Programming Lab course. It includes various packages for (super/sub)classes of numerous types of rides, amusement park visitors (a.k.a amusers), pools and exceptions. The project was implemented using Java. Detailed documentation is included within the code. Two test files and a small post-project task code are included in corresponding packages. You can run the tests on Eclipse IDE (after adding JUnit 4 to build path).

II) The second project, SANTORINI, was an implementation of the classical board game as a local multiplayer computer game. This was a group project where I have worked with 2 other students. We have worked together on the logical design and game engine implementation. However, for the GUI, I have worked on 85-90% of it by myself. Rather than remaining traditional, we've decided to be more creative by adding a theme to our board game. The visuals, sfx and music were all centered around Batman and the Joker. I have worked on the GUI design and implementation of JPanels, JLabels, JButtons, text fields and other constituents, and adding images/music (all of which belong to Warner Brothers Entertainment, Rocksteady, Netherrealm and DC Comics) to add more to the simple board game. To start the game, kindly run the project on Eclipse IDE.
